# Base-Business
1. git clone
2. "envVariables" branch
3. npm i
4. npm run postinstall
5. I don't use watching mode
so use "tsc" for build TS  int JS into ./bin folder
6. I recommend VSCode use menu for launch app for debug
#  Scenario
1. you have to make new base customer (Business) and set its phrase to  environment variable  (e.g. BUSINESS_PHRASE=rookie wonder mistake nothing whip theme feed card disease identify cushion nephew)
2. create offer with price (e.g 1 CAT). Add some fields which will be shared with business ( the field “eth_wallets” is required  )
3. add record eth_wallets  to customer (if you have not done it yet), and sharable fields
4. as customer you create Search request
5. match the search request (from customer) and offer (from business)
6. open (customer account) search request and grant access
7. money (e.g 1 CAT ) will be paid from business to customer
